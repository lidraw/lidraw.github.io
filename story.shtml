                <a class = "brief__container message__color-gradient-pink">Emu is all happiness and innocence.
                     She acts upon her ideas without a second thought, sometimes to the consternation 
                     of her friends. She's searching for like-minded performers to help her bring a 
                     deserted stage in Phoenix Wonderland back to its former glory.</a>
                <a href="#message2" class="button">Tsukasa Tenma</a>
                <a class = "brief__container message__color-gradient-yellow">Tsukasa has bucketloads of confidence 
                    and loves to be the center of attention, although he easily gets carried away. A 
                    theater show he saw as a kid impressed him so much that he made it his ultimate goal 
                    to become the greatest star in the world. He's a supportive brother to his frail 
                    sister, Saki.</a>
                <a href="#message3" class="button">Rui Kamishiro</a>
                <a class="brief__container message__color-gradient-blue">Nene's neighbor and childhood friend, 
                    Rui is an easy-going genius. He's meticulous about making every show the best it can 
                    be, making use of his flair for technology and inventiveness. He even builds robots 
                    to use on stage. His somewhat unique way of thinking often gets him labeled as a weirdo.</a>
                <a href="#message4" class="button">Nene Kusanagi</a>
                <a class="brief__container message__color-gradient-green">Nene joined the group at 
                    Rui's recommendation. She's sharp-tongued, but honey-voiced, with the singing 
                    ability of a budding musical star. For some reason, she refuses to show herself 
                    to Tsukasa and Emu, deploying Robo-Nene to perform shows in her place.</a>
